            Im intrigued by how people interact with technology and the small
            details that shape their experiences. My design process revolves
            around understanding users' needs, motivations, and challenges, and
            translating that understanding into intuitive and impactful
            solutions.

            Growing up, I saw firsthand the hard work and resilience of small
            business owners in my community. Their struggles with limited
            resources and visibility inspired me to use design as a way to
            empower them. I believe that great design can level the playing
            field and help dreams grow into realities.
